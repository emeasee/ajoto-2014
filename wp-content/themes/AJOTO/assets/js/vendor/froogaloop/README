Froogaloop Microframework.
Copyright 2010 Vimeo, LLC.
@author: Joseph Schmitt

Froogaloop is a small Javascript utility framework to help with the complexities
involved in dealing with using the Javascript API through window.postMessage
for controlling Vimeo's Moogaloop video player. This framework provides a simple
API to call functions and add event listeners to Moogaloop when it is embedded
using an <iframe>.

USAGE:
The Froogaloop framework automatically searches the document for all iframes that
are embeds of Vimeo videos. It then adds two new functions to the iframe HTMLElement:
api and addEvent. To call a function that acts upon the player (such as play, pause,
or seek), use the api method. To add an event listener that listens for player
events, use the addEvent method.

NOTES:
1. To gain JavaScript api access to the Vimeo player, you must pass in a value of 1
   for the js_api url parameter to the iframe.
2. If you have more than one iframe per page, each iframe must have a unique id attribute
   set and that id must be passed to the iframe via the js_swf_id query parameter.


EXAMPLE:
var iframe = document.getElementById("myIframe");
iframe.api("api_play");
iframe.api("api_seekTo", 30);
iframe.api("api_setVolume", 80);

iframe.get("api_getDuration", function(duration){
   // Handles duration checking
});

iframe.addEvent("onPlay", function(player_id){
   // Handle onPlay event
});

iframe.addEvent("onSeek", function(time, player_id){
   // Handle onSeek event
});


If any iframe embed codes are added to the page via a script or AJAX call, then you will
have to manually call Froogaloop.init so that they get the proper methods. Froogaloop.init
takes an optional parameter that is a NodeList of iframe elements that should get the new
methods. If none are specified, it will look for all iframes on the page.
