			<p>WHO WE ARE<span>At AJOTO we create beautiful tools for everyday journeys, combining the precision of advanced manufacture with the soul of craft. Inspired by modern nomadic ideals, our products form a collection of essential items which embrace the spirt of travel.<br><br>
			Established in 2011 by designers Chris Holden and Tim Higgins, AJOTO was founded upon a vision where the journey of production was just as important as the destination. Based in the heart of London we take time to develop our ideas and seek out manufacturing specialists who share our values. By collaborating closely with them, we develop elegant and affordable products which can be used everyday and treasured for a lifetime.</span></p>

		<p>ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY<span>It is our responsibility as designers and manufacturers to think harder about reducing waste and eradicating the use of harmful chemicals from everything we do. We have worked hard to use materials which are recyclable and can be traced to their sources. Of equal importance is the quality of our products. Manufactured to the highest industry standards ensures that wherever you go and whatever you do they will last a lifetime.<br><br>
		We have done our best in being open and transparent throughout our supply chain in order to minimise our impact on the environment. If there are any areas you feel we can improve feel free to get in touch.</span></p>
